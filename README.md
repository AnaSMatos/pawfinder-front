# PawFinder

Pawfinder is a heartwarming project that combines my passion for programming and love for pets. The app serves as a social network dedicated to pet adoption, where users can apply to adopt pets they connect with.

## Technologies Used

The front end of the application is built using modern web technologies, including:

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a seamless and dynamic user experience.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language for building interactive and responsive features.
- **Styled Components**: A popular CSS-in-JS library that allows for the creation of styled components with a focus on reusability and maintainability.

The entire front-end architecture was configured from scratch, showcasing a personalized and optimized setup.

## Project Highlights

Working on PawFinder has been an immensely gratifying experience, bringing together two things I am passionate about â€“ programming and pets. It's not just a technical project; it's a platform with a noble cause, facilitating the adoption of pets and connecting them with loving families.

While the project is currently not live, here are some snapshots to provide a glimpse of the user interface:
